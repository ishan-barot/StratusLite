# stratuslite - project summary

## what i built
stratuslite is a c# automation tool that wraps common dotnet commands
. simple concept but builded properly with good practices.

## technical stuff i used

### core development
- **process management**: used process.start with async/await to run shell commands
- **cross-platform**: had to figure out windows vs unix shell differences (cmd vs bash)
- **error handling**: proper exception handling and user feedback
- **clean code**: tried to keep it readable and well-structured

### devops
- **github actions**: set up ci/cd that actually uses the tool to build itself
- **multi-platform testing**: runs on ubuntu, windows, and macos
- **documentation**: wrote a decent readme with examples

### testing & quality
- **unit tests**: used xunit for testing the main features
- **project structure**: proper .net solution with separate test project
- **git practices**: meaningful commits and proper branching

## technical details
- **language**: c# with .net 8
- **architecture**: simple console app with modular design
- **testing**: xunit framework
- **ci/cd**: github actions
- **platforms**: cross-platform compatible

## what it shows
- i can write clean, working c# code
- i understand process management and system integration
- i know how to set up proper testing and ci/cd
- i can create cross-platform applications
- i follow good software engineering practices

## skills demonstrated
- c# language features (records, pattern matching, async/await)
- system programming (process execution, platform detection)
- testing methodologies
- devops practices
- technical documentation

the project is small but shows i can build something from scratch with proper architecture, testing, and deployment
. it's the kind of tool i'd actually use in real development work.
